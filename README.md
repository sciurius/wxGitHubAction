# wxGitHubAction

This repo is an attempt to develop a GitHub Action that builds wxPerl.
It is intended mostly for Microsoft Windows systems, that need setting up wxWidgets first.

## Current state

* Strawberry Perl is installed
* wxWidgets are fetched and installed
* Alien::wxWidgets is added
* wxPerl is fetched and build

However, wxPerl is not functional due to library load problems.
Help is appreciated.
